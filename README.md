# volve-drilling

This is the reproducible version of the article that was originally published in [my blog](blog.OilGainsAnalytics.com), and in LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-drilling-data-from-volve-dataset-witsml-r-alfonso-r-reyes/).


In this repository you will find the following assets:

* All the code in a Rmarkdown notebook as running in the blog. That includes the last four plots at the end.

* The Volve drilling datasets for three wells used in the Rmarkdown notebook.

* An R script `witsml-trajectory.R` that has functions that allow quickly to convert a WITSML trajectory dataset to a dataframe.

* Images that were inserted in the publication.
